        Initiates a new manuscript file save session for chunked upload.

        This method sets up the necessary directory structure and creates a unique
        session to handle the chunked upload of a manuscript file. It prepares the
        temporary file path and stores session metadata for later chunk operations.

        Args:

                - project_id: Identifier for the project where the file will be saved
                - relative_path: Relative path within the project directory
                - filename: Name of the file to be uploaded

        Returns:
            str: Unique session identifier (UUID) that must be used for later
                 chunk upload operations and session completion

        Raises:
            OSError: If directory creation fails due to permissions or disk space issues

        Note:
            - Creates the target directory structure if it doesn't exist
            - Normalizes the relative_path by removing leading slashes
            - Uses "." as relative_path if empty (root of project directory)
            - Generates a temporary file with format: "{filename}.{session_id}.part"
            - Stores session data in memory for later retrieval during chunk operations
            - The session must be completed with finish_manuscript_save_session()
